IWBTG HTML5 Port
================

This project is in an early state.
The purpose of this project for me is to understand certain game mechanics and try to get the best performance out of HTML5's canvas.
It uses no existing gaming libraries.

###Implemented core features

  * Spritesheet class
  * Vec2 class
  * Loop class
  * Ticker class

I also aim at providing basic mobile support.  
Right now it runs quite well (60fps) on my old android device.

### Controls

  * WASD / Arrows: Move
  * Space: Jump
  * Shift: Shoot

----

#### Next Step

  * Implement entitie class
  * Implement map loading

I will be using my recently created and active editor project [Online-Tile-Map-Editor](https://github.com/elias94xx/Online-Tile-Map-Editor).
