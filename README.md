IWBTG HTML5 Port
================

This project is in an early state.  
The purpose of this project for me is to understand certain game mechanics and try to get the best performance out of HTML5's canvas.  

**It uses no libraries whatsoever.**  
Here is a list of core features I've implemented so far:

  * Spritesheet class
  * Vec2 class
  * Loop class
  * Ticker class

I also aim at providing basic mobile support.  
Right now it runs quite well (60fps) on my old android device.
